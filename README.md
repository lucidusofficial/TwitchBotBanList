# TwitchBotBanList

A curated list of Twitch accounts identified as bot accounts or IP grabbers, intended to help streamers and moderators proactively block and protect their channels.

## ⚠️ Warning
Do not visit, click, or interact with any of the accounts listed. Interaction may expose you to IP grabbers or other malicious behaviour.

## 📝 About the List
* Accounts are sorted **A–Z**
* One account per line
* Duplicate entries are removed before updates
* Intended for moderation and safety purposes only

## 📂 Ban List Files

Includes two versions of the ban list for ease of use across different moderation setups:

- **`banlist (slash).txt`**  
  Uses Twitch’s native `/ban` command.  
  This is the **recommended and most reliable** option, as `/ban` is officially supported across Twitch chat, Mod View, and most bots.

- **`banlist (dots).txt`**  
  Uses `.ban` syntax for convenience.  
  This is included for users who rely on bots or clients that support `.ban` aliases or custom commands.

Both files contain the same accounts and are kept in sync.  
Choose the format that best matches your moderation workflow or bot configuration.
